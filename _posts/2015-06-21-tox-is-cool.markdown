title: Tox is damn cool.

A few months ago, [I wrote an article about the need of increased distribution](/2015/02/23/the-issue-is-centralization.html). I stand by everything I said in that, but I feel I neglected a simple issue: privacy. 

Distribution affords a level of privacy that I would imagine offends any kind of government (or at least it *can*), and nothing exemplifies this more than the [Tox](https://tox.im) project.

Tox is a completely distributed chat application, with end-to-end encryption, and VoIP capabilities that is entirely open-source, and I think it is the best new IM client since the fucking invention of SMS. 

CHeck it out, I don't have a lot to say.
