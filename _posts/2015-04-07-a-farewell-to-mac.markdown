The day was young, and I arrived at work early.  After recovering from a recent bout of food poisoning, my mental state was fair from perfect, but it didn't feel like it was limiting my abilities, and I sit, doing work, listening to NOFX, sipping on a Diet Coke in the process.  

A coworker arrives, and this job being relatively close knit, the greeting devolves into a conversation, and a relatively hearty one at-that, so I put my drink down, and embrace the fact that I won't be working for a bit.  

We chat for around twenty minutes, and I turn back to my laptop, foolishly forgetting the can of soda, and as quickly as it was stupid, knocked it over onto the keyboard of the Mac. 

The thing wouldn't boot, so I took it to the Apple store, and the price to fix it was estimated price to fix everything was eight hundred dollars, which I couldn't justify since that's the price buying a new laptop. 

So that's what I did. 

### I will miss Mac. 

I actually grew to rather like OS X.  It wasn't perfect, but it was a decent operating system, only bested by Arch Linux, at least in the scope of the ones I've tried. 

### I'm not completely impressed with Mac hardware

The Apple hardware isn't *bad* by any means, but it's expensive as shit, and there are parts that drove me crazy. I hated that the Macbook Air *still* didn't have a 1080p screen.  Christ, even my *phone* has a 1080p screen, and that thing was literally a thousand bucks less. 

Also, the big glowing Apple logo is kind of obnoxious.

So I'm done with Mac.  It was a fun ride, but I'm happy to be back on Linux.
