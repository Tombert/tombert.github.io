New York University was never a good place to work.  

When I first started, I had a suspicion that my idealized vision of what academia would be like were short-sighted, but I had already uprooted my life, moved to New York, and figured that I was just being negative, and that my fantasies of being the "underqualified-professor" would eventually come true.  

*They did not*. 

Come six months later, and I'm realizing that boring, inconsequential work is not made any more rewarding with the `.edu` extension on my address, and that a job with incompetent management that refuses to adapt is worsened by my inner demons of frustration.  

After a certain point, I start wondering if it's even worth it to come into work, if it's even worth wasting the energy.  I'm underpaid, angry, and feeling an overwhelming sensation of disappointment. 

After all this, the managers got sick of my attitude, and they decided to not renew my employment contract. 

### Thank. Fucking. Santa. 

I was upset about being laid off for almost exactly ten minutes, and then I moved on with my life. 



## So the job hunt begins. 

I find myself unemployed, but I have a few distinct advantages this time.  First, most people haven't become disillusioned to academia yet, and a lot still share my idealism on that front, and thus the title of "research scientist" sounds good, even if it was short-lived. 


I wonder if I'll ever figure out a good way to market being good with interviews.  Sometimes it seems like what I was born to do is giving good first impressions.  

Anyway, after twenty-two interviews and four offers, I got a job doing Erlang development, which has been quite fun.  This job has a lot less pretense about it, and it pays better, despite it not having the the "brand-name" of NYU. 

So that's what's happened in my life.

I'm happy, but lest prestigious.
