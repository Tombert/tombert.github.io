title:  "You aren't saving money, so accept my fucking credit card."

I recently took a business trip to Philadelphia for the Society for Research in Child Development conference, which was fun, albeit kind of weird. There is something abundantly odd about going to a conference targeted towards PhD'd child-psychologists, and having to explain that I am not-in-any-way-trained in pscyhology, and in fact, and not-in-any-way-trained for anything else, for that matter.  It's a strange, but oddly rewarding experience, as long as you define the word "rewarding" as "really fucking nervewracking", and I do. 

Anyway, I went to lunch at a place called "Reading Terminal", and I saw there was a "world famous" cheesesteak place.  Now, a good cheesesteak sandwich is one of those near-perfect foods for me, and I figured that I'm already in Philly, it makes logical sense to have a cheesesteak.  

I order it up, and whip out my credit card to pay, and the cashier says "We don't take cards, cash only.  There's an ATM down there". 

I decided I was no longer hungry and skipped lunch. 

### Why is this still an issue? 

I am genuinely annoyed that this still happens, and it happens substantially more in the northeast than the south.  Considering how low-tech everyone here seems to think Dallas is, at least it was relatively easy to survive using entirely-digital transactions. 

And I think that's the key point: we *should* be moving into a more-digital direction.  Requiring physical money now is like requiring someone to mail a physical letter to send a message, and if I did have someone who mounted that as some sort of requirement, I would probably just avoid talking to that person. 

### But Tom, there's a charge from the credit card companies on the small business blah blah blah blah...

Well, *somehow*, nearly every business in the south, small and large, can manage to afford this fee.  Oh yeah, that's probably because [people spend almost fifteen percent more when using a credit card](http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/tips/credit-cards-make-you-spend-more/), which will negate any fees from the credit card companies.  Hell, require a minimum-purchase limit if you want to be sure.

### Credit cards are better.

One big advantage of credit cards is the guarantee from the companies that if your card is stolen, you aren't liable for any lost money.  If you have cash on you, and you get mugged, which isn't particularly unlikely in a place like New York, then that cash is lost.  I mean, I know New Yorkers are fond of everything being fucking expensive, but they should at least take issue with money being *lost*. 

And let's not forget that cash is a [disease vector](http://www.rense.com/general88/filt.htm).  Whenever you take cash out of a machine, you have the risk of someone's cold, AIDs, and semen just being rubbed all over it, dried on as an invisible timebomb waiting to strike right before you go on vacation. 

### It's time to boycott. 

I'm not saying these businesses shouldn't be allowed to have these restrictions, I'm saying that as a society, we shouldn't put up with this shit. We should start taking our business elsewhere when we're told we have to start using antiquated old paper.  

Of course, maybe I'm just a whiny moron who should carry cash around.
