Hello All, 

I've been looking for a new blogging platform for awhile now.  I built something using Ghost, and it's cool and all, but my biggest complaints have been a lack of version control, and the fact that you have to host it yourself to avoid ads. 

Subsequently, I'm going to be trying out Jekyll.  I get free hosting on the awesome [github.io](http://github.io), which will also give me version controlling.  I'll have to look for something to do math equations.
