title:  "Academia is interesting"

You can get off the edge of your seat, because I officially live in New York now, and have started my research job, for better or worse. 

Academia is interesting, and thus far I have to say that the mentality change is crazy. 

Here are some examples:

### People actually care about correctness.

At my last job, rewrites weren't really something we did.  Being an advertising agency, it was a lot more about getting a product done than getting it done right. I'm not knocking it, it's just how it is working on client applications. 

This hasn't been the case with the project I've been working on.  My new boss told me he's rewritten the entire project from scratch three times, and is in the middle of his fourth rewrite, and is actually getting me to help with said rewrite.   

It's kind of trippy; I've never really had a job that budgeted full rewrites, but I think it's pretty rad. 

### There really aren't regular hours.  

This might not be true if you're a professor or something, but for a lowly researcher like me, I can pretty much come in whenever I want, be it six in the morning or noon.  

I actually have had a job that did that, but that company went bankrupt after screwing me over, so I didn't think it actually happened anywhere else. 

### There really aren't "deadlines"

Getting stuff done is important, but, as mentioned in point one, getting it right is of higher priority. 

---------

It's trippy, but oddly enough, completely expected. Apparently I dream too accurately.
