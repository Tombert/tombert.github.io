I have spent the last four days in New York, not for vacation, not for work, but for scouting out apartments.

It's one of thsoe things that they don't like to mention in movies accurately.  In fairness, I'm not sure there's a particularly good way to express "GOOD FUCKING SANTA, A SODA COST HOW MUCH?!", but perhaps that's something Hollywood could work on to de-romanticize the city for us suburban folks.

Actually, I'm not sure even that would have worked, I love this city.  As I've said before, and I'll say again: It's where shit goes to happen.

But apartments are still expensive.  Being paid more helps, but on the place I've settled, I've had to sit with an "only-mildly-scary" area, for two-thousand dollars a month.  At least it's still on Manhattan, right?

You don't really get much more legit-NYC than Harlem, right?  It's pretty much Harlem, south-Brooklyn, and the Bronx to feel like a genuine New Yorker, though I might be confusing the word "legit" with "stupid".  Don't quote me on that.

At least I'm not in New Jersey.
