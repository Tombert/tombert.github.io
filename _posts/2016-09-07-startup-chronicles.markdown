### A Memoir

I remember the exact moment that I gave up on physics as a career, and it began with a half-bottle of stolen aspirin, sleep deprivation, depression, and my skipping of a New Years party.  

Staring at my report card, and seeing that I passed none of my classes (likely due to the fact that I had skipped most of them), I realized I wasn't as smart as I had hoped, my career as a physics professor was dashed, and I was having none of it.  

With a final thought of relief, I down the remaining tablets in the bottle, and with that, a feeling of peace set in.  


For about five minutes.  

I then get a text message from a Erin, a girl I met on the internet, a girl I had decided I was in love with from the moment I had talked to her, asking how I was feeling, and that she had a crush on me, and she hoped I was feeling better about my grades. 


I realize I've made a terrible mistake, and I run to the bathroom and start gagging myself to force out the medicine, which is my first successful venture in months, and in my vomiting, confused, tired state I make a decision: I can't go back to school, I need to get a fucking job, and I need to figure out a way to meet this girl in person.  

Covered in sick at two in the morning, my mind felt clear, probably because I didn't have a headache, thanks to the aspirin. 

-------------------

At the time, I didn't know any professionals who hadn't finished college, and I start applying to every cashier job in Orlando.  

A week goes by, and after applying to seventy-four locations (including fast-food, retail, hotels, Disney World, and Universal Studios), and I haven't received a single call, and something is clearly wrong.  

As a joke, I look on Craigslist for a job in web design.  I had been doing some basic HTML since gradeschool, but never being paid for it, and I figured I could send a resume over, I send a cover letter where I assume it's obvious that I'm lying due to fucked up chronology, they'd get a laugh, and I'd continue my search for minimum wage. 

To my shock and surprise, the company called back the next day for an interview. 


---------------------

### AMS

Amerinational Management Services (or AMS) is a company that I had never heard of that performed a service I had never heard of: a Tae Kwon Do studio billing and management company run by Grand Master YK Kim. 

Bizarrely, it felt like AMS decided to conduct their interviews in the scariest fucking place they could find in Orlando; a Detroit-esque near-dilapidated house in the middle of nowhere.  

I drive to the address that my GPS guided me to, and I wonder if I put in the address incorrectly...People who go into these houses usually go in to get raped and/or murdered. 

I park in the driveway, and I figure that I had just tried to kill myself anyway, and I walk in. 

There are five people in the office, all of which seem confused as shit that I'm there.  

"I'm here for the 11:30 interview for a web developer...My name is Tom".  I realize as I say that that I probably should have worn something other than jeans and a T-Shirt. 

People start rushing around to find their bosses and eventually an older Asian man comes up to me and gives me a piece of paper with a series of arithmetic problems for me to solve, which I do with relative ease in roughly fifteen minutes.  

The Asian man returns and asks about my experience doing Coldfusion and Flash development. I tell him that I hadn't done a whole lot with Coldfusion, but enough with Flash to feel competent (which was a lie), and he has me interview with their leader of technology, Ed. 

I immediately liked Ed, though I'm not sure he felt the same way about me.  He had a rather jolly demeaner at most points, and he seemed genuinely excited that someone even applied to the job.  We chat for about twenty minutes, and I'm more nervous than I've been since my first date.  This was my livelihood at stake, and I hadn't done an interview for a "big boy" job. 

The chatting goes well enough, and then Ed gives me a piece of paper with a bunch of questions about the Coldfusion language. 

Now, if you, the casual reader, has never used Coldfusion, I envy you, but it's effectively a language designed for people who are used to HTML to get started with server-side web-development. 

I tell you this to explain what was on the test, but twenty-one-year-old-me had no idea what he was doing. I got literally every single question on the test wrong, and the entire process was humbling.   

With this, I figure I had blown the interview, I say goodbye, and I go home.  

An hour after I get home, I get a call, explaining that they're desperate for more developers, and they will hire me for thirty-five thousand dollars a year.  

I get drunker than I had ever been before that night, and feeling bizarrely satisfied.  


-----------------------------

As in turns out, the Tae Kwon Do industry is a great place to get started with web development.  Since the product wasn't necessarily a "technology" in the bragging sense, things like Big-O notation weren't particularly important.  If I shipped crappy code, it wasn't a big deal unless it broke.  

"Welcome to startup culture" a friend would later tell me. 

But there were weird eccentricities to the company.  For example, the software people literally worked out of a utility closet where the lights were turned off, along with three servers.  To clock in, I had to scan my fingerprints on a reader.  The location was above a PetCo store, and we could occasionally hear the animal noises.  It felt like the programmers were somewhat of an afterthought.  

I have a bit of trouble holding back when I'm annoyed, and I make a point to tell people when I'm pissed off.  This clearly starts to irritate my coworkers, and eventually I start getting in trouble.  Instead of adjusting my behavior, I start figuring out ways to work alone.  

-----------------------------

Four months go by, and every night I am talking to Erin over the phone, and for better or worse, the relationship starts to escalate.  We exchange the typical "I love you", we talk over webcam, we try doing "cyber-sex", which might as well have been real as far as I was concerned: I was still a virgin.  

I decide that there's no future in Orlando, and I start applying to jobs in Dallas, where Erin lives, and much like the first, it didn't take long for me to find one: Wyndham Jade, a convention planning company. 

And with that, I was moving to a city to be with a girl I was in love with that I had never met in person.
