I remember the exact moment that I gave up on physics as a career, and it began with a half-bottle of stolen aspirin, sleep deprivation, and depression, and my skipping of a New Years party.  

Staring at my report card, and seeing that I passed none of my classes (likely due to the fact that I had skipped most of them), I realized I wasn't as smart as I had hoped, my career as a physics professor was dashed, and I was having none of it.  

With a final thought of relief, I down the remaining tablets in the bottle, and with that, a feeling of peace set in.  


For about five minutes.  

I then get a text message from a Erin, a girl I met on the internet, a girl I had decided I was in love with from the moment I had talked to her, asking how I was feeling, and that she had a crush on me, and she hoped I was feeling better about my grades. 


I realize I've made a terrible mistake, and I run to the bathroom and start gagging myself to force out the medicine, which is my first successful venture in months, and in my vomiting, confused, tired state I make a decision: I can't go back to school, I need to get a fucking job, and I need to figure out a way to meet this girl in person.  

Covered in sick at two in the morning, my mind felt clear, probably because I didn't have a headache. 

-------------------

At the time, I didn't know any professionals who hadn't finished college, and I start applying to every cashier job in Orlando.  

A week goes by, and after applying to seventy-four locations (including fast-food, retail, hotels, Disney World, and Universal Studios), and I haven't received a single call, and something is clearly wrong.
