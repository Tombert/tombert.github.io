The internet is, in most ways, one of the greatest inventions of all time.  In most ways, it's the compendium of all knowable information, ever-growing, and perhaps most importantly, adaptable.  Jokes about how it's filled with cats aside, it really is a pretty phenominal resource, far more useful than anything else.

####Despite all this, it's a completely broken model.

Praising aside, just because something is *useful* doesn't mean it's not broken, and the current model for how the internet is run is completely busted.

Here's my problem, imagine I found an interesting site where people can post interesting videos, about pretty much whatever they want, and they can be shared and stored by and for me.  [I'm sure this seems familiar](http://www.youtube.com/).  What's wrong with this model?

### It's expensive.
In this particular example, we're transcoding video into a nice format that's compatible with nearly every device out there, ensuring a higher number of views.  This is all well and good, but it has one *huge* disadvantage: transcoding video is really expensive.

[It cost Google three-hundred-sixty million dollars to run Youtube in 2009](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2009/04/do_you_think_bandwidth_grows_on_trees.html), and that was six years ago.  That's nearly a million dollars a day for people that are fucking morons and can't do simple math.

Now, a giant corporation like Google can afford something that costs a million dollars a day without much trouble, but for average folks, that price is simply unachievable.

Now before you say it, I realize that you don't just go from zero-to-Youtube overnight, but I will say that without some rather clever programming tricks, it is extremely difficult to get even-small-scale transcoding done on a regular salary.

It costs [$0.015 per minute](http://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/pricing/) to transcode video using AWS.  Now, let's pretend that you have a very small, mini-Youtube that hosts only one-thousand five-minute videos, that comes out to $75 per month.  Now, again, not unachievable, but keep in mind that a thousand videos is pretty damn close to nothing, and we're already starting to get out of the "hobby-budget" of most people.  Now, let's say you get mentioned on Reddit or something, and suddenly you get ten-thousand videos coming in per month, which now equates to seven-hundred fifty dollars, which starts to become a substantial amount, especially if you haven't secured good advertising to help level out the costs, and keep in mind, this isn't even considering bandwidth costs, regular server scaling, maintenance, etc.  

This long justification is to explain one fundamental problem with Youtube (and really any large-scale site): It costs so much to run that only already-rich corporations can compete.

What's wrong with big corporations?

## Big corporations have to please people.

In a lot of ways, this is a good thing.  Things like child pornography and verbal threats can be removed by a benevolent dictator looking out.

Well, ass-kissing dictator, really.  But still a dictator.

But, like the issues with nearly all dictators, the temptation for corruption becomes too great.

It takes just a [cursory look on Google](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/technology/09link.html?_r=0) to see how Youtube has taken things too far with censorship.

And the thing is, it's totally necessary.  Depending on the audience they want to attract, they might need to keep things censored and clean, because, as stated above, millions of dollars are on the line.  They can't afford to be taking too many risks.

---------------------

I don't really mean to pick on Youtube here.  They're just an easy target, but the same complaints can be levied at nearly any large website.

### So what's the solution?

There isn't any one solution, at least not that I've seen, but the best fix would be to decentralize more of the internet.

This would fix both problems.  If more of the internet were stored in a cryptographically signed distributed mesh, then no one person would be footing the bill, since it would be split amongst everyone.  This would also be invulnerable to a dictatorship ruining things, and you could keep things more democratic.

I dunno, this is just some insomnia-induced ramblings, and I can tell already that this isn't particularly well-written. Oh well.  I'll write something funny tomorrow night to level it out.
