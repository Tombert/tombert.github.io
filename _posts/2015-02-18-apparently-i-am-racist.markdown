My friends might have noticed that I deleted my Facebook account, and might be even more surprised to find out that I have zero intention of bringing it back. 

"Tom, you crazy bastard, why on earth would you take yourself off of Facebook?  Is it because of the NSA?  Is it because of the massively overzealous marketing and data aggregation companies using the things you like to direct personalized ads?"

I care very deeply about all those issues, and none of them were enough to actually go through the deletion process.  Apparently I don't care that much and I'm entirely full of shit.  

I guess the thing about it is that everyone knew Facebook was recorded, and that the way they were making money had to be through advertising.  What did they expect, that they were just going to be benevolent overlords, providing a free service without demanding anything in return? 

No, the reason that I deleted my Facebook really just came down to the fact that I kept getting in arguments with feminists. 

And here is the obligatory-though-annoying disclaimer that I have to put whenever I want to criticize feminism: I agree with *most* of feminism. If there is a wage gap, then we absolutely should fix that, if women are discriminated in the workplace, we should fix that as well. 

Ok, got that out of the way.  You fucking overly literal and underappreciating morons can stop leaving me comments telling me how sexist I am, and and you can go living your boring lives on Twitter because thinking of something that takes more than one-hundred-forty characters is too difficult.

ow to read subtext.  Get off of Twitter and read a fucking book, or at least a god-damned [Cracked](http://www.cracked.com) article. 

Anyway, rambling aside, I commented on someone's thread on Facebook.  I can't remember the exact wording, but it had something to do with the "Je Suis Charlie" thing and how apparently they were racist. 

I commented explaning that I kind of think it's irrelevant to whether or not the *Charlie Hebdo* dudes were racist: the "Je Suis Charlie" thing was about free speech, both good and bad.  

Something I've learned about modern feminists is that they *hate* free speech.  They hate that the Klan members are allowed the same rights that everyone else is, they hate that a Neo-Nazi member can give his bullshit agenda, and they *hate* that people can espouse a viewpoint that disagrees with theirs.  

So after my comment, some dude comments explaning that me sticking up for Charlie Hebdo makes me a racist, since I'm white, and black guys can't be racist because they are the oppressed group.  

### So I do what anyone would do in my situation: I read a fucking dictionary.  

> racism
> The belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.
-- [Oxford Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/racism?searchDictCode=all)

I thought I had a smoking gun.  I thought that the guy was going to read that, apologize, and amend what he said to something a bit more applicable, since I certainly didn't say anything that would indicate I thought any less of any different races. I now think that I am stupid for ever expecting a moron to say anything that was not moronic. 

The guy responds back with something along the lines of "This just proves my point because you're using a racist definition of the word". You heard right people: 

## Apparently Oxford is a racist institution.  

I mean, this should come as no surprise.  Everyone knows that Oxford is really just the Klan hangout, where they enjoy a good lynching before class, then a good holocaust celebration afterwards.  Oh wait, I'm not a fucking moron, of course that doesn't happen. 

Jesus fucking Christ, how the fuck do you even argue with someone like that?  How do I go about explaining how flawed of reasoning that logic is to someone?  How does one have a discourse with someone who is going to project an ad hominem attack on me because I use a fucking *definition* from the fucking **OXFORD DICTIONARY**?

And I am just getting madder and madder at this, until I realize that this is a debate tactic.  

The word "racist" has an implicit negative connotation, so much that if you are called a racist, people immediately think you are an asshole, for good reason.  I do not fit into the standard definition of the word, so how does someone with no argument go about winning?  By redefining the word!

See, if he can redefine words, it's not hard to call me something horrible like "racist", because he can make me (at least loosely) fit into it.  Then the nuanced negativity of the word can do the rest: no one takes you seriously after that.  

And once that thought hit me, I realized that this is pointless. I'm getting upset with someone who cares more about winning an argument on facebook than he does about being honest, and people like that (just like marketing people) simply aren't worth my (admittedly pretty worthless) time, and with that I deleted my account.  

I will not be back on Facebook any time soon, but this entire thing has given me an idea on a new personal project.
