I've been using Github for awhile, and it really is a great service. I can't think of another service that has done more to help open-source (or Free Software as Stallman has repeatedly "corrected" me on).  You know what, no, that's not just going to be tucked away in a parenthese, I don't like the GNU term "Free Software".  Using the words like that inherently will conflate it with freeware, and doesn't sound nearly as cool as open-source, so fuck it, it's open-source.

Anyway, what the fuck was I talking about?  Oh yeah, Github, I've used it for a fairly long time, since 2011 or so. It's a very well-built service, and I put pretty much everything on there now: projects, resumes, and hell, even this blog. This isn't a rant against Github, but more of a criticism of myself.

### Why am I just getting around to using the "fork" button?

Seriosuly, I've seen the button there for years, I've known what it does, I've known how it works, and until recently, I've always just asked for commit rights to a project directly.

I've seen the light, and I realize what I've been missing.  I'm a goof.  I've started forking projects that I commit to.

There's not a lot to this post, I just wanted to make fun of myself.
