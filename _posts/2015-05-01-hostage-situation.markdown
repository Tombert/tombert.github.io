title:  "Stop playing your music on the fucking subway."

I take the subway to work now, every day, and for the most part it's an excellent form of transportation.  It's fairly eco-friendly, it's cheap, and it's probably the fastest way to get around the city...Well, besides helicopters. God damn, that would be cool.  I'd parachute into my office, busting through the window, and be like "COME WITH ME IF YOU WANT TO LIVE".  Every day.  I'm sure that wouldn't get old. 

You know, a helicopter would probably solve my biggest problem with the subway: people who want to play their shitty music loudly and then beg for tips. 

God damnit, I didn't know I could hate anything so much, but if anything good came out of this situation, it was that I learned something about myself, and it's that I hate public entertainers.  

Well, wait, no, that's not even true.  I don't care if they're playing their shitty music at a park, or a restaurant, or *anywhere fucking else than the subway*.  A subway is inherently a captive audience, so it's essentially a hostage situation, though instead of being murdered, I have to listen to shitty mariachi music.

And after the music is done, they have the gall to ask for tips.  Why the fuck should I give you a tip?  You were meeting a demand that exactly zero people had.  You fail at capitalism, and life, and you should leave me alone. 

The worst part is that apparently it's illegal to shove these people out of the moving train.  I guess just another bit of evidence that New York is a nanny-state.

I'm working on an actually-serious series of articles, but these require a bit more planning.  I'll release them soon.
