> Twenty-five is too fucking young to be this fucking old.

This thought, this sentence, this is the central theme and thesis of every thought flowing through my brain in the last two weeks.  

Time is a linear process, but aging, that happens independently.  

It's hard to believe as much crazy shit has happened to me in just twenty-five years. So many jobs, so many stories, so many mistakens, so many people, and I'm barely old enough to rent a fucking car.  

And the maddening parts of it are the questions: Why am I so old?  What is the source of the cynicism, anger, and frustration? As of right now, I have no fucking clue, but I have an idea. 

So, arrogant as it may be, I've decided to chronicle my job history thus far, the best that I can remember it, so as to have an understanding of my own life.   

History happened, and it's immutable; any mistakes in its retelling are mine and mine alone.
