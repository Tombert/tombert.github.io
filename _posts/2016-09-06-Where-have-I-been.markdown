So I have been neglecting my blog a bit more than I should. 

Seriously, my writing skills get rusty so damn easily, I really have no excuse for not doing this more. Yesterday I was writing an email, and I didn't even get the impression that everyone thought I was incredibly smart afterwards. 

There weren't any other adventures yesterdays.  Thanks for asking.  

So where have I been exactly?  It's a fascinating story, really.  You'll be glad you asked, just like my adventures yesterday. 

Immediately after the last post, someone broke into my apartment by crashing into the window, crying out in the name of the holy ghost and Bruce Willis, asking for whisky.  I decide to oblige him, and we start talking about how *Die Hard* was a kickass movie, and soon afterwards we became friends, and while I will keep him nameless for respect and reasons that will become obvious later, we can call him Richard, or Dick for short. 

So we decide to leave my apartment, and the second we get outside, some people start freaking the fuck out, saying shit like "what the hell are you guys doing?" and "put some pants on, son." 

Oh, I forgot to mention, we were naked.  It's a long story.  

So we drop into a store to buy some pants, but the people there were still being all irritating, so I decided to just grab the first clothes I could find and get out of there, and so I grab a zoot-suit hanging on the rack and I'm happy enough with my decision when I discover that it comes with the tradition zoot-suit-hat. 

Dick, on the other hand, was not too happy with the selection, because he said that nothing really went well with his vibe, and I get tired of waiting around, and so I just tell him to put something on so we can leave and get some ice cream or something, but Dick's having none of this, so he proceeds to torch the place down. 

Well this upsets everyone, because it turns out that burning down Salvation Army stores is illegal in the state of New York, and everyone inside starts freaking out, and so the police arrive and start talking to us. 

I tell Dick that he's been through enough, not being able to find clothes and all, so I take the fall for it, and so the police arrested me and sent me to jail for six months.  

While in jail, I start studying the lost art of ninjitsu from a person who claimed he was Asian or something.  I think he was Asian because he made me call him "Chang", and I don't usually question that.

Chang taught me how to do useful shit like killing a guy just by looking at them and also how to fill out a tax form.  As it turns out, the IRS doesn't legally count a venus fly trap as multiple mouths to feed, and it is therefore not deductible on taxes.  That was news to me, hopefully this helps you out too. 

Anyway, that's where I've been for the last six months.  Overall, it's been a little boring which is why I haven't posted much about it.
