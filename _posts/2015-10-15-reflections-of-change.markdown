In three months, I will have been a "professional" software developer for four years.  The titles have changed from "Junior Software Developer" to "Software Engineer" to "Application Developer" to "Research Scientist" back to "Software Engineer", but the basic job has been the same: "enter code into a box, and we'll pay you". 

"Professional" is in quotes for a variety of reasons; the fact that I still don't have a degree, the fact that I haven't had a dress code for three of those four years, and the fact that I don't *feel* professional in the slightest.  There's this lingering feeling of me being this kid who just writes scripts trying to play with the big boys, but through magic and voodoo I doubt I'll every fully comprehend, I've managed to not only play with, but in some rare cases, even outcompete the other "professionals". 

Looking back at old code and writings, it's crazy to see how much I've changed.  Discovering Git, being introduced to functional programming, thinking that Erlang was stupid until I actually tried it, growing disillusionment towards C++, feeling that working in advertising was "beneath me".  Oh yeah, also, moving to Dallas... That was a weird chapter in my life.  

And then I realize all this shit took place in *less than four years*.  That's not even a full high-school run, and I've moved twice, and learned a countless number of new things.  

Here's to four more industrious years.  Hopefully they will be as exciting and productive as the previous ones.
