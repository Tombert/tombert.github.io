I'm definitely not an ops guy.  

It's weird, I tend to think I'm pretty proficient with Linux, but then something as somple as "setting up a domain name with Github pages" becomes illusive.  I guess the simplicity of DigitalOcean has spoiled me, but I got to learn a few things about `CNAME` and `A` records. 

Something like this is always humbling.  It's easy to get into the "I know everything" mindset, and it takes a few "oh god I'm an idiots" to correct for it. 

Anyway, (gebert.sexy)[http://www.gebert.sexy] works now.  No more paying for hosting!
