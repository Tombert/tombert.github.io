Yeah, I know it's been awhile since I've posted anything.  I'll write something about what's happened to me in the last six months, but I don't feel like talking about myself that much, as will become clear by the choice of book that I wanted to talk about today.

------------------------------------------------------


Invader Zim was always a cartoon I appreciated, if only because it's one of the only truly terrifying shows targetted towards children, while still managing to be funny, and visually interesing to watch, but it wasn't until recently that I discovered that the creator (Jhonen Vasquez) had a whole slew of dark, strange comics that I had never read, and with that, I hopped online to find a copy of *Johnny the Homicidal Maniac*. 

Upon reading the "Director's Cut", I can say this: *Johnny the Homicidal Maniac* is a dark, cynical depiction of the acts of loathing, depression, and self-sabotage, and a hell of a lot more inciteful than it had any right to be, and this is a place to collect my thoughts on it.  

There will be little order, and even less coherence to my ramblings here.  

### Depression

Probably the most obvious themes that prevail throughout the comic are depression and self-loathing.  Johnny's dialog with inanimate objects reveal a tortured person, unhappy with the way he is, unhappy with society, and unhappy with the prospect of staying alive.  Every suicide attempt fails, prolonging the hurting. 

### Self-sabotage. 

The less-obvious metaphor that I picked up while reading was that the murders, brutal as they are, symbolize self-sabotage and self-destructive tendencies.  Despite having a successful date with a his dream-girl, Johnny ruins the entire thing by attempting to murder her. Johnny has a conversation with one of his victims that seemingly could be a friend, only to kill him a few minutes later to harvest his blood.

When a copycat killer comes to admire Johnny, someone whom he could genuinely relate to, he summarily executes him while giving this speech: 

> Imagine a sculptor being confronted by a stranger, who, as it turns out, confesses to revere our sculptor. Imagine the flattery known to anybody who is told they've inspired some noble aspiration in somebody. The student then presents our sculptor with a work fashioned after the sculptor's own style - a likeness of the student himself. It is a monstrosity! A fucking mess. Even worse, is that our artist sees that this piece of shit before him is a more reasonable facsimile of his own work than he'd like to think. You fucking idiot!! Admire me?!! You shit!!! I'm the villain in this fucking story!

This seems to be a recurring thing; Johnny has an aversion towards being happy, and the way out of that is murder. 

### A lack of consequence. 

This one might be due more to me digging than intended by Vasquez, I think buried in the subtext is this message: we *don't* face consequences for most of the horrible shit we do.  

Johnny kills almost indiscriminately, in public places, in broad daylight, but is never apprehended (or even suspected) by any authorities.  Even when Johnny semi-successfully kills himself and is sent to Heaven and Hell, there's a surprisingly small amount of shits given about his horrible acts.  

In reality, cops, judges, or God pale in comparison to guilt when it comes to prescribing consequences.

I'll update this in the future if I think of most stuff; I mostly just wanted to articulate a few thoughts I had on this comic before I forget them.
