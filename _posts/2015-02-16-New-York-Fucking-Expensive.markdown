So in my last post I talked about how I got my dream job, living in New York, working as a researcher, blah blah blah.  It wasn't a really good article, too emotional.  Well, no, not too emotional, that works ok, but emotional in the sappy-happy-Hollywood-ending kind of way, which is annoying.  It certainly needed some more swear words and cynicism. 

But the cynicism wasn't readily apparent when I wrote that article.  It really did feel like my dreams came true, with the only thing missing was Bruce Willis busting into my apartment and carrying me away on a firehose, but I recently found out something that should have been apparent from the get-go: 

## New York is a God-Damned money pit.  

Seriously.  I'm getting a fifty-percent  pay-increase at this research job, and that sounds pretty awesome, until I looked up [CNN's cost of living converter](http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/) and realized I was actually going to be making about three-thousand less a year after adjustment.  

Not that it really matters, the work will be more fun, and I've survived on much less.  

But still, trying to find apartments is a fucking headache: I need to show my three most recent paystubs, and while I make plenty to qualify for an apartment in Dallas-money, I don't make nearly enough (yet) to qualify for a good apartment in New York.  

Anyway, I'm going to try and keep this blog more or less updated.  The Github pages format fits my way of working a bit better, and who doesn't love markdown?
