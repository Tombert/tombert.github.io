So, enough of these overwrought, inciteful posts for the time-being.  They're too much of a departure from my normal, zany style involving multiple four-letter-words and whining about the subway or something.  



----------------------------------------------------------------------------


I live in Washington Heights, Manhattan, which has slowly become my favorite part of the city.  The prices aren't too unreasonable, the apartments are fairly large, and the people are fairly personable.  

That lattermost point has caused me to become friends with most of my neighbors, which is already suspect.   As a general rule, the only religion I practice is that of misanthropy, with the patron saints of Hunter Thompson and Stephen Fry.  

This ideology has been validated by a set of recent occurrences, all involving the same neighbor (who, for legal reasons, shall remain nameless). 

It all started about three weeks ago, when this neighbor approached me on the street, obviously stoned out of his fucking mind, and started preaching to me about Jesus, which isn't particularly weird in this area.  Washington Heights is an incredibly Catholic area, and most of my neighbors make that point abundantly clear.   
Anyway, he starts talking about Jesus or something, I start arguing (see: previous point about misanthropy), and it's friendly enough, and it evolves into regular conversation, and the topic of what we do for a living comes up.  
 
He explains that he does "deliveries", which, from my admittedly stupid perspective, is code for dealing drugs.  This guy is perpetually stoned, his eyes are yellow, and frankly, I would have been surprised if he had said anything other than "deliveries".

I then explain that I program computers for a living, and he asks "Oh!  Do you make apps?". 

"No dude, I program servers and move data around and stuff", and he doesn't seem to know what I'm talking about. 


"Well, you see, I had this idea for an app, man. It'll be killer, if you build it, I'll pay give you twenty percent. "

I further try and explain. "I don't make apps, dude.  I don't even know how. I can probably refer you to an agency or something that might be able to help you out. " 

"Come on man, it can't be *that* different, it's killer idea, we'll both be rich". 

He's not taking no for an answer, and I am getting weary of this conversation, so I tell him that he can email me some requirements so I can give him what I think it'll cost. 



------------------------------------------------------------------





I've made a terrible mistake. 

I've received six emails thus far, all of which have given increasingly absurd requests for an individual developer, and I tell him very-much-unridiculous prices of two-hundred-thousand dollars.  

He keeps asking for a "friend discount", and I keep explaining that I'm not building the fucking app, just giving price estimates, and this isn't a fucking drug deal, this is labor. 

Now this guy is pissed off at me, because I'm shitting all over his million dollar app idea.  




----------------------------------------------------------------------







I really don't understand that people unaffiliated with computers can't comprehend that computer science is, you know, a fucking *science*, and like all sciences, there are about four-hundred-billion different parts to it.  


So I want to make this point abundantly clear.  I will not: 

- Build your shitty app for free. 
- Get rid of a virus on your computer. 
- Fix your computers broken hardware. 
- Fix your mom's computer
- Make your website "look nicer". 


I hope that this clears up any god damned confusion.
