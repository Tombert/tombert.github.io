My ambitions weren't ever very lofty.  I think that's always been a kind of frustration with my family and friends.  "Tom, you should be studying so that you can get a good job!".  "I'd rather be watching *Die Hard*, Mom!", though depending on the age, you probably could replace the movie with porn.

The only thing I ever really wanted to do with my life was researh topics that seem interesting to me, and overwhelmingly those topics tend to involve mathematics and computers.

There's a name for people like me: professors.  Or wannabe professors, I guess. Professors have qualifications.

I recently accepted a job as a researcher and programmer at New York University, and the entire situation is pretty surreal.

I'm twenty-four years old, and I just got my dream job handed to me.   I don't know what that says about my dreams, probably that I'm not ambitious enough.

Regardless, I didn't expect a job like this to hit me until I was in my forties, and here it is, sixteen years early.

It's crazy, exciting, nervewracking, and a few permutations of those words. New York City is a big change from Dallas, academia is a big change from corporations, and I'm a big change from what I used to be.

Looking back at the stuff I did over the years, it's surreal to see how much I've grown as a programmer, and I hope the trend continues
