title: What is the point of Twitter?

I was looking at my posts recenty, and I determined that I didn't have enough that made me seem pissy and/or old, so to remedy this problem, I'm going to write a short rant about the latest cultural phenomenon that I simply do not understand:

#### Twitter.

What do you actually *do* on Twitter?

To find out, I made an account, and this is the only thought that came into my head:

> Is Twitter's success basically an admission that most people secretly wanted the career of writing fortune cookies?

Which, ironically enough, made a fairly good tweet, so I posted it.

But I'm not completely joking. Anything interesting I have to say usually requires a few paragraphs of rambling, followed by a friend telling me to leave them alone and asking how I got their number.

This isn't close to the first time society went apeshit over something that I thought was simple and pointless, but it *is* the first time that it's happened since I watched *Inception*.

I guess I'll just continue blogging, while remaining confused about what the rest of the world is doing.
