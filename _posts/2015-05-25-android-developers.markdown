I, like any other sane human on the planet, shop a lot on Amazon.com.  This should be a surprise to exactly zero people reading this, but I confess; I order nearly everything I use. 

As a result, it's no shock to hear that I purchased an Amazon Fire TV for two reasons: a) To stream Netflix, and b) Amazon advertises pretty heavily that the device can be used as a game console, and even [started their own game studio](https://games.amazon.com) to promote it.  

The first game I purchased for the system was Goat Simulator, since I remember enjoying it a lot on PC, and almost immediately I was filled with disappointment. 

The Android port of Goat Simulator is a fucking joke.  The fact that they have the nerve to charge the same price for this shitty-ass port is insulting, and I genuinely felt ripped off.  

Trying to remain positive, I purchased Deus Ex: The Fall, and was greeted with similarly awful results.   As a last-ditch effort, I downloaded the port of Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath, and was surprised that it is an absolutely competent port.  

And that's the part that frustrates me and the rest of the Android community so much.  Games like Stranger's Wrath prove that Android *can* be used to produce a great game, but most developers don't seem to take the platform seriously. 

Now, on the phone, this is more tolerable.  You don't necessarily care about advanced 3D graphics when you're just playing a game for five minutes on the train, and that's understandable.  

But I don't think that's a good excuse.  If we take a look at Android's biggest competitor, iOS, it's a very different story.  The 3D games on there are of noticeably higher quality (I was particularly impressed with the iOS port of Dead Space), and the 3D games on there just seem to have a lot more polish.  And this baffles me, as iOS requires the use of a relatively niche language (Objective-C), and strict adherence to the Cocoa API, which is in stark contrast to Android's approachable Java API, as well as Android's excellent support for native apps using the NDK. Hell, I could write a fucking app in [Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Android) if I really wanted to, so I find it really bizarre that there aren't more high-quality programmers writing for the platform.

Also, let's not forget something important here: Android isn't just a phone operating system anymore.  Android-based media players are selling like fucking hotcakes, and right now, [Android is the world's most-deployed OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems).  It's not just a shitty phone-system anymore, it's *the* OS that is powering nearly everything now. 

I also don't think that "Apple is better-currated" is a good excuse either.  If you look at the Windows world, there are plenty of high-quality games for it, and that has been a basic "wild-west" of software since its inception, and I think it comes down to this fact: developers take Windows seriously as an operating system (more than they should, in my opinion), and as such they make better products for it. 


So this, my fellow developers, is a plea, a begging, and an ask: Please stop making *lazy* Android ports, please don't just re-export your Android-phone game to the Ouya or FireTV and expect it to be any good, and please do not charge the same as the PC counterparts if you're not going to put even a tenth of that work into it.
