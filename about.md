I'm an eccentric with several interests.  Here is a list of them. 

## Software. 

Programming shit is fun, figuring out why certain code works or doesn't work is interesting, and it's also what I do fo a living, which, as a consequence, forces deep-seeded, whiney opinions on a plethora of computer-related subjects. 


## Arguing with people. 

There's no need to have a description for this.  Let's move on. 


## Math

I suppose this is related to the software thing, but I'm very-much interested in theoretical math, even though I'm too stupid to understand it most of the time.
